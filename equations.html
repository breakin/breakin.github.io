# Introduction

Just some notes I am taking down on different subjects. Mostly my derivations of different formulas, keeping a few extra steps to make it easier to follow (at least to me!). Note that pseudo-code might be numerical unstable, it is mostly there to make the math concrete. This document will be corrected as I realize things that are incorrect and new sections might appear! Feel free to request things, ask about things that are unclear or point out mistakes. You can reach me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/anders_breakin).

# Tangent Frames

## Rotate Coordinate frame

Sometimes we construct a result in a simple local space and want to transform the result into the correct space for the solution. A common case is that we are supposed to construct a result around a forward vector $N$ but instead we construct it in a space where the direction corresponding to $N$ is $(0,0,1)$. Below I've outlined a simple way to do this. It has a few issues in more advanced scenarios but it works as a starting point!

Warning: Pseudo-code below is untested and probably needs negation of some cross product!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vec3 minor_axis(v) {
	if (abs(v.x) < abs(v.y)) {
		if (abs(v.x) < abs(v.z)) {
			return vec3(1,0,0)
		} else {
			return vec3(0,0,1)
		}
	} else {
		if (abs(v.y) < abs(v.z)) {
			return vec3(0,1,0)
		} else {
			return vec3(0,0,1)
		}
	}
}

// note: x,y,z are scalars, forward is a vec3
vec3 rotate_frame(x,y,z,forward) {
	m = minor_axis(forward)
	x_axis = normalize(cross(forward, m))
	y_axis = cross(x_axis, forward)
	return x_axis * x + y_axis * y + forward * z
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numerically improved version to this solution can be found [here](http://jcgt.org/published/0006/01/01/). Another [alternative](http://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/quaternions/2016/07/06/Orthonormal.html) for you who are familiar with quaternions was suggested by Marc B. Reynolds.

While these improves numerical precision and/or performance they might still not be optimal in *when* it introduces discontinuties in the generated tangent frames. That issue can't be avoided for the very same reason that most 3d-objects can't be textured without introducing seams. At the seams te tangent basis will flip completely. To give an example on where this might matter we can think of the basis that is generated for different parts of a curved mesh with forward set to the surface normal. At some positions there will be a discontinuity where the x_axis and y_axis suddenly will change suddenly. Depending on how the basis is used this might visible and the application might want to put those "errors" in certain places. Thus there might be other choices to be made here as well. 

## Update tangent frame for splines/particles

A handy formula that I've used many times can be found in the article ["Calculation of Reference Frames along a Space Curve"](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/gilles.gesquiere/Teaching/iut/A2/IN/CM11/ref-frames.pdf) (Jules Bloomenthal, published in Graphics Gems, vol. 1). I always found the article very cute and useful and I want more people to know about it (if they don't already).

The problem is tries to solve is the following. We have something such as a particle in a particle system or a path (think spline in space). Initially it has a position and a forward direction as well as an arbitrary tangent-direction that is perpendicular to the forward vector. Together with the forward vector it can be used to build a coordinate frame to align something such as a mesh (in the particle case) or some 2d-shape being "stamped" along the path (think of a tube that has the cross-section of say a 2D-star pattern). We don't want the mesh or star pattern to twist too much or to make sudden jumps (as would be the case if we just constructed a random basis with the only constraint that forward should be forward). I really recommend reading the paper since it has good figures.

I've mostly used the simplified expression that the paper says Ken Sloan suggested. The idea is that we have calculated a new forward direction and we remember the old tangent (normal to the path) here called old_tangent. This snippet updates the tangent.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
temp_bitangent = cross(old_tangent, new_forward)
new_tangent = cross(new_forward, temp_bitangent)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the tangent can be stored as a single scalar if you need to save space. It can be expressed as an angle in the with forward as the normal. The x_axis and y_axis can be constructed as in our $rotate\_frame$ method. It is no problem if they have discontinuties as long as it is constructed the same way each time. 

In many cases the tangent might be inherent from the simulation of the particle or from some analytic form of the spline of the path, but in the cases where they are not, I really like this simple method.

# Spherical Coordinates

To go from spherical to cartesian coordinate we can do
\begin{eqnarray}
x &= & r \sin{\theta} \cos{\phi} \nonumber \\
y &= & r \sin{\theta} \sin{\phi} \nonumber \\
z &= & r \cos{\theta} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
with $r>0$, $\theta \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi \in [0,2\pi]$. The angle $\theta$ is called theta and the angle $\phi$ is phi. If we only want the upper hemisphere we should limit $\theta$ to $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$.

When integrating diredctions on the surface with $r=1$ we need the factor $\sin{\theta} d\theta d\phi$ to account for the fact that the parametrization is not uniform over the sphere (a change in $\theta$ does not lead to a linear change in area of surface elements). When we integrate like this we say that we integrate over differential solid angles.

# Random Numbers

## CDF

If $p(x)$ says how likely it is to generate $x$ then the CDF $F(x)$ says how likely it is the generate a value smaller or equal to $x$. $F$ is the integral of $p$.

It we want to know the probability that an event in the range $x \in [x0,x1]$ happens then we can calculate $\int_{x_0}^{x_1}p(x)dx$. This is the same as $F(x_1)-F(x-0)$. This is exactly how summed area tables work; turn an integral (or sum) into two evaluations.

TODO:
* Show using a graph p(x) and F(x).

# Random Distributions

In my mind there are three types of distributions:
1) Requires a fixed amount of random numbers. Can be used many times. Example: Point On Sphere.
2) Requires a variable amount of random numbers. Can be used many times. Example: Anything using Rejection Sampling.
3) Can only generate a certain number of directions/points. Does not require any random numbers. **All** points/directions needs to be taken to cover say a sphere in a good fashion. Example: Point on Sphere using Spherical Fibanacci.

These distributions can be combined with good random sequences with good properties to improve sampling further. Hopefully I will write some abou that later but the buzzwords are: Stratified Sampling using jittered samples, Blue noise Random Numbers and Low-discrepency sequences.

## Inverse CDF sampling

First I will talk about a tool that is very useful to derive expressions for random sampling. It starts with a probability function that describes the distribution we want. It must be properly normalized so that it integrates to 1.0. It is then integrated to form a new function called the CDF (cumulative distribution function).

Lets say we want to generate 1D-numbers with a probability proportional to $x^2$ (with $x \in [0,1]$. We integrate this expression and get the number 3. The proper probability distribution function then is $p(x)=3x^2$. We want to get the CDF and to do that we integrate again. This time we don't want a value but a new function. We call the CDF $F$ and we get $F(x)=\int_0^x \widehat{x}^2 d\widehat{x} = x^3$. Here we need to introduce a new variable $\widehat{x}$ since x is already spoken for as the parameter for $F(x)$.

Now while $p(x)$ says how likely it is that $x$ is generated $F(x)$ says how likely it is that a value smaller or equal to $x$ is generated. If $p(x)$ is non-negative it will be an monotonically increasing function that is invertible. If we look at the x-axis we have the events we are interested in. If we look at a range of x-values from say $x_0$ to $x_1$ they will map onto a contiguous range on the y-axis. If the $p$-values in that ranges are small they will correspond to a small range on the y-axis. If they are large they will correspond to a large range. This is the same as saying that the CDF $F$ grows quickly where $p(x)$ is large.

Now $F(x)$ will take values from 0 (since $F(0)=0)) to 1 (since $F(1)=\int_0^1 p(x) dx = 1). If we had our graph tabulated somewhere we could take a random number from 0 to 1. If we got say 0.3 we would pick 0.3 on the y-axis and then trace right to where we found the CDF $F(x)$. Let say they intersects at $x=0.8$. Then we will generate the x-value 0.8.

By inverting $F(x)$ we get a function $F^{-1}(u)$ that does exactly this.

Everything is analog in the 2D-case. If $F(a,b)$ can be factored into $F_a(a)F_b(b)$ then they can be inverted independantly. Each will be driven by one random number. This is not always the case.

If $p(x)$ is zero outside a range then we just look at x-values in that range to make sure we get an invertible CDF.y that 

TODO:
* A picture is worth more than a thousand words!
* In the 2D-case it is not always so that the partition into $F_a$ and $F_b$ is unique. What rule then can we use? Currently I need to inspect the resulting inverses to make sure they cover the correct ranges.

## Random point in sphere (or spherical shell)

We want to construct a function $random\_in\_sphere\_shell(r_0,r_1,u_0,u_1,u_2)$ that generates an uniform point in a shell of a sphere (the part between radius $r_0$ and $r_1$ in our case). The variable $u_0, u_1, u_2$ are random uniform numbers. As a special case we will get a formula to generate random points in a sphere as well by setting $r_0=0$. I'm doing it this way since some people might want to generate numbers inside a shell (perhaps for generating particle positions in a particle system).

What do we need? First lets assume that we can generate a point on the surface of a sphere using a function $random\_on\_sphere(r, u_0, u_1)$ where $r$ is the radius of the sphere and $u0,u1$ are two uniform random numbers in the interval $[0,1)$. Any point on the sphere is equally likely to be generated given that $u_0,u_1$ are uniform. Once we've chosen a radius $r \in [r_0,r_1]$ we can use $random\_on\_sphere$ with that radius $r$ to get our final point. Our current challenge then seems to be to pick $r$.

What properties do we need from $r$? First it needs to be in the range between $r0$ and $r1$. Furthermore we don't want to get a small radius as often as a large; we want the number of points chosen for a particular radius to be proportional to the area of a sphere with that radius. Larger sphere should give more points.

Let use formulate a probability function for the radiuses. The area of a sphere is $area\_sphere(r) = 4\pi r^2$. We seek a function that gives out a radius with $p_{radius}(r) \propto area\_sphere(r)$. We use the sign $\propto$ to indicate that it is proportional to $area\_sphere$. In order to get an exact expression we need to normalize it such that $\int_{r_0}^{r_1} p_{radius}(r) = 1$. Using integration of $area\_sphere$ we get

\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{r_0}^{r_1} area\_sphere(r) dr & =&  \frac{4\pi}{3} (r_1^3-r_0^3) \\
p_{radius}(r) & = & \frac{4\pi r^2}{\frac{4\pi}{3} (r_1^3-r_0^3)}, r \in [r_0, r_1] \nonumber \\
p_{radius}(r) & = & \left (\frac{3}{r_1^3-r_0^3} \right) r^2, r \in [r_0, r_1] \\
\end{eqnarray}

Now that we have the desired probability function we need to find a function that generates radiuses according to it. To do this we can use the method of inverse CDF sampling. First we need to integrate once more to find the CDF $F$. We get

\begin{eqnarray}
F(r) & = & \int_{r_0}^{r} p_{radius}(t) dt, r \in [r_0, r_1] \\
F(r) & = & \left (\frac{3}{r_1^3-r_0^3} \right) \frac{r^3-r_0^3}{3} \\
F(r) & = & \frac{r^3-r_0^3}{r_1^3-r_0^3}
\end{eqnarray}

Now we want to find the inverse $F^{-1}(u)$ of $F(r)$ in the interval $r \in [r_0, r_1]$. We know that it is invertible there since $p(r)>0$. We change name of $F(r)$ to $y$ and solve for r. We get
\begin{eqnarray}
y & \equiv & \frac{r^3-r_0^3}{r_1^3-r_0^3} \\
y (r_1^3-r_0^3)+r_0^3 & = & r^3 \\
\left[ y (r_1^3-r_0^3) + r_0^3 \right]^\frac{1}{3} & = & r \\
\end{eqnarray}

Now $r$ is our $F^{-1}(u)$ and we get
\begin{eqnarray}
F^{-1}(u) & = & \left[ (u (r_1^3-r_0^3) + r_0^3 \right]^\frac{1}{3}
\end{eqnarray}

We see that $F^{-1}(0)=r_0$ and $F^{-1}(1) = r_1$ as expected. We can now sample $F^{-1}$ using a random number $u$. Here is pseudo-code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vec3 random_in_sphere_shell(r0,r1,u0,u1,u2) {
	a0 = pow(r0,3)
	a1 = pow(r1,3)
	r = pow(u2 * (a1-a0) + a0, 1.0/3.0) 
	return random_on_sphere(r, u0, u1)
}

vec3 random_in_sphere(radius,u0,u1,u2) {
	r = pow(u2 * pow(radius, 3), 1.0/3.0)
	return random_on_sphere(r, u0, u1)
}

vec3 random_in_unit_sphere(u0,u1,u2) {
	r = pow(u2, 1.0/3.0)
	return random_on_sphere(r, u0, u1)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If $random\_in\_sphere\_shell$ is called many times then $a1-a0$ and $a0$ can be sent in as constants to avoid the costly $pow$ calculations.

But what is the probability of choosing the point we get? We aimed to get uniform sampling of the shell. The volume of the sphere is $volume\_sphere(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$ and thus the volume of our shell is $volume\_sphere(r_1)-volume\_sphere(r_0) = \frac{4}{3} \pi (r_1^3-r_0^3)$. The probability to choose a particular point should then be $\frac{3}{4 \pi (r_1^3-r_0^3)}$. This is constant and integrates to 1.

We should be able to arrive at the same number using the probabilities from choosing the point. The probability of choosing a particular point using $point\_on\_sphere(r)$ is $\frac{1}{4\pi r^2}$ (one divided by area of a sphere with radius $r$). The full probability then becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{point\_on\_sphere}(r) & = & \frac{1}{4\pi r^2} \\
p_{radius}(r) & = & \frac{3r^2}{r_1^3-r_0^3} \\
\left( \frac{1}{4\pi r^2} \right) \left (\frac{3r^2}{r_1^3-r_0^3} \right) & = & \frac{3}{4\pi(r_1^3-r_0^3)}
\end{eqnarray}

which is exactly the same expression we arrived at when using the volume of the shell.

### Rejection Sampling

A rejection sampling based method could look like this
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// rejection sampling variant, not preferred
vec3 random_in_sphere_shell(r0,r1,random_generator) {
	while (true) {
		x = random_generator.uniform(-r1, r1)
		y = random_generator.uniform(-r1, r1)
		z = random_generator.uniform(-r1, r1)
		d2 = x*x + y*y + z*z 
		if (d2 >= r0*r0 && d2 <= r1*r1)
			return vec3(x,y,z);
		// loop again and try a new point
	}
}

// rejection sampling variant, not preferred
vec3 random_in_unit_sphere(random_generator) {
	while (true) {
		x = random_generator.uniform(-1, 1)
		y = random_generator.uniform(-1, 1)
		z = random_generator.uniform(-1, 1)
		d2 = x*x + y*y + z*z 
		if (d2 <= 1.0)
			return vec3(x,y,z);
		// loop again and try a new point
	}
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't like to use rejection sampling for two reasons. First the running time is not certain which gives the processor more to do (especially on a GPU). Secondly it requires a lot of random numbers and in many applications it is not possible to draw an arbitrary number of random numbers. This is especially true when using low-discrepancy sequences or tabulated blue noise random numbers.

## Random point on sphere

This will be going quite fast! Look at some of the other derivations to get a feeling for the inverse CDF sampling procedure!

We have $p(\theta, \phi)=\frac{1}{area\_sphere(1)}=\frac{1}{4\pi}$ (which is normalized since it integrates to 1 over the sphere). We go straight to inverse CDF sampling.

\begin{eqnarray}
F(\theta, \phi) & = & \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_0^{\phi} \int_0^{\theta} \sin{\widehat{\theta}} d\widehat{\theta} d\widehat{\phi} \\
& = & \frac{\phi}{4\pi} (1-\cos{\theta}) \\
F_{\phi}   & = & \frac{\phi}{2\pi} \\
F_{\theta} & = & \frac{1}{2}(1-\cos{\theta})
\end{eqnarray}

These are easily invertible and we arrive at the two following expressions to go from random numbers $u_0, u_1$ to $\theta, \phi$ on the sphere

\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\phi}^{-1}(u_0) & = & 2\pi u_0 \\
F_{\theta}^{-1}(u_1) & = & \arccos{(2*u_1-1)} 
\end{eqnarray}

When dividing up the $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ I choose $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ to go with $\phi$ since I knew that it would lead to $\phi$ spanning exactly one turn around the circle. I don't know if there is a robust way to split it up without assuming something like this.

Pseudo-code time:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vec3 random_on_sphere(radius,u0,u1) {
	phi = 2*PI*u0
	cos_theta = u1*2-1
	sin_theta = sqrt(1.0-cos_theta*cos_theta)
	x = radius * sin_theta * cos(phi)
	y = radius * sin_theta * sin(phi)
	z = radius * cos_theta
	return vec3(x,y,z)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Random point on hemisphere

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vec3 random_hemisphere(normal,radius,u0,u1) {
	vec3 p = random_on_sphere(radius, u0, u1)
	if (dot(p, normal) >= 0)
		return p;
	return -p;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the direction ends up in the wrong hemisphere we simply negate it. The probability is uniform over the hemisphere.

## Random point on hemisphere - $cos^n$-weighted

We want to generate direction in a hemisphere around a forward direction. We want to have more directions parallell to the forward direction and fewer sideways. No directions in the negative hemisphere (behind the forward direction). We will qualify this exactly soon. We divide the solution into two steps. We start by generating directions in a simpler space where the normal direction is replaced by $(0,0,1)$. When we are done we will transform them into the final space using $rotate\_frame(x,y,z,forward)$.

The usual case for importance sampling a lambert material model is to have $n=1$ but I've made it a bit more generic if someone wants to try it for the reflections in say a phong material model. If you do try it for a phong model then care must be taken since quite a few of the directions will go behind the plane of the intersection. Perhaps rejection sampling can be used. Either way care must be taken so that the solution is still unbiased and energy conserving.

To make this easier we will jump to spherical coordinates. It is quite common when working with directions over the sphere or hemisphere.

What probabilty function do we want for out result? The angle $\theta$ dictates how far we are from the forward direction. In spherical coordinates our probabilify function is $p(\theta,\phi) \propto \cos^n{\theta}$. Now how do we normalize it? If we start with the case wher $n=1$ and integrate $\cos{\theta}$ over $\theta \in [0,\frac{\pi}{4}]$ we get the value 1. But that is not the value we are looking for. This time splitting the probability into a part that depends on $\theta$ and one on $\phi$ does not work. Instead we need to integrate $\cos{\theta}$ over the full hemisphere. In doing so we must not forget the differential solid angle $\sin{\theta}d\theta d\phi$ in our integral to compensate for the fact that the sphere is shrinking closer to $\theta=0$. This come from the spherical coordinates parametrization.

Before we jump head first into this we need to solve an integral that will come in handy very soon. We want to find the integral of $\int \cos^n{x} \sin{x} dx$ for $n>0$. The solutions is based on the reverse of the chain rule (as outlined [here](http://sydney.edu.au/stuserv/documents/maths_learning_centre/chainrulereverse.pdf)). First we restate the chain rule as well as some simple derivation rules that we will need
\begin{eqnarray}
y(x)  & \equiv & f(g(x)) \\
y(x)' & = & f'(g(x)) g'(x) \\
\cos'{x} & = & -\sin{x} \\
(x^n)' & = & \frac{x^{n-1}}{n}
\end{eqnarray}

Now we try to put out integral on the form of $y$ above. This seems possible since $-\sin{x}$ happens to be the derivate of $\cos{x}$. We get
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x)  & \equiv & \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \\
g(x)  & \equiv & -\cos{x} \\
y(x)  & \equiv & f(g(x)) \\
      & = & -\frac{\cos{x}^{n+1}}{n+1} \\
f'(x) & = & x^n \\
g'(x) & = & \sin{x} \\
y'(x) & = & f'(g(x)) g'(x) \\
      & = & \cos^n{x} \sin{x} \\
\int_a^b \cos^n{x}\sin{x}dx & = & \left[-\frac{\cos^{n+1}{x}}{n+1}\right]_a^b
\end{eqnarray}

If we have an expression whose derivate becomes the function we want to integrate, then we know the integral! It is that simple! Finding that expression can be hard. Armed with this integral the rest will be simple! First we make sure $p$ integrate to 1 so it is a proper probability function
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\theta,\phi) & \propto & \cos^n{\theta} \\
\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos^n{(\theta)} \sin{(\theta)} d\theta d\phi & = & 2\pi \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos^n{(\theta)} \sin{(\theta)} d\theta \\
 & =& 2\pi \left[-\frac{\cos^{n+1}{\theta}}{n+1}\right]_0^{\pi/2} \\ 
  & = & \frac{2\pi}{n+1} \\
p(\theta,\phi) & = & \frac{(n+1)\cos^n{\theta}}{2\pi}
\end{eqnarray}

For the special case where $n=1$ (as when we need to importance sample a diffuse lobe) we have that $p(\theta, \phi) = \frac{2\cos{\theta}}{2\pi} = \frac{\cos{\theta}}{\pi}$.

It is time to use inverse CDF sampling. To the inverse CDF sampling-o-mobile! 

\begin{eqnarray}
p(\theta,\phi) & = & \frac{(n+1)\cos^n{\theta}}{2\pi} \\
F(\theta,\phi) & = & \frac{n+1}{2\pi} \int_0^{\phi} \int_0^\theta \cos^n{\widehat{\theta}} \sin{\widehat{\theta}} d\widehat{\theta} d\widehat{\phi} \\
 & = & \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{\phi} d\widehat{\phi} \right) \left( (n+1) \int_0^\theta \cos^n{\widehat{\theta}} \sin{\widehat{\theta}} d\widehat{\theta} \right) \\
               & \equiv & F_{\phi}(\phi) F_{\theta}(\theta) \\

\end{eqnarray}

Here at last we can seperate $F$ into two 1D-functions that we can do inverse CDF sampling of individually. We get

\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\phi}(\phi) & = & \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{\phi} d\widehat{\phi} \\
               & = & \frac{\phi}{2\pi} \\
F_{\theta}(\theta) & = & (n+1)\int_0^\theta \cos^n{\widehat{\theta}} \sin{\widehat{\theta}} d\widehat{\theta} \\
                   & = & (n+1)\left[-\frac{\cos^{n+1} {\widehat{\theta}}}{n+1} \right]_0^{\theta} \\
                   & = & 1-\cos^{n+1}{\theta}
\end{eqnarray}
 
Inverting them gives us our expressions to go from random numbers $u_0, u_1$ to $\theta, $\phi$

\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\phi}^{-1}(u_0) & = & 2\pi u_0 \\
F_{\theta}^{-1}(u_1) & = & \arccos^{\frac{1}{n+1}}{(1-u_1)} \\
 & = & \arccos^{\frac{1}{n+1}}{(u_1)} \\
\end{eqnarray}

Here we use that $1-u_1$ and $u_1$ both are uniformly distributed in the interval $[0,1]$. Now inverse trigonmetry functions have a bad reputation but sometimes they vanish when actually used. In our case we only need $\cos{theta}$ and $\sin{theta}$. For the first we are happy, we just drop the $\arccos$ completely. For the latter we can use the [Pythagorean trigonometric identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#Pythagorean_trigonometric_identity) that says that $1=\sin^2{x}+\cos^2{x}$. Thus we can replace the $\arccos$ call with a sqrt. Care must be taken to handle cases where the argument to sqrt can become negative since sqrt is not defined for negative numbers (at least if we expect real numbers as the result).

Time for pseudo-code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vec3 random_hemisphere_cosine_pow(normal,n,u0,u1) {
	phi = 2*PI*u0
	cos_theta = pow(u1, 1/(1+n))
	sin_theta = sqrt(1.0-cos_theta*cos_theta)
	x = sin_theta * cos(phi)
	y = sin_theta * sin(phi)
	z = cos_theta
	return rotate_frame(x,y,z,normal)
}

vec3 random_hemisphere_cosine(normal,u0,u1) {
	phi = 2*PI*u0
	cos_theta = sqrt(u1)
	sin_theta = sqrt(1.0-cos_theta*cos_theta)
	x = sin_theta * cos(phi)
	y = sin_theta * sin(phi)
	z = cos_theta
	return rotate_frame(x,y,z,normal)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we can see we have no calls to $\arccos$.

## Spherical Fibonacci Point Sets - Point on Hemisphere (uniform or cos-weighted)

WIP: I need to properly verify the formulas here.

This is just some code I wrote after reading [Spherical Fibonacci Point Sets for Illumination Integrals](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.5568&rep=rep1&type=pdf). It is a type of generator that let the user select a number of points $N$ and then it can generate them using an index. In order to get a good sampling of the hemisphere/sphere all $N$ points must be used or there will be gaps. This is a good example of a method that uses the golden ratio to do something randomish. The method is also somewhat unique in that it generates points directly on the sphere. Most other methods have a scheme to generate good random numbers and then another scheme to get the onto the sphere. The paper claims that this method has no seam issue whereas other methods might have.

We can generate points on the hemisphere (using spherical coordinates) as:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
z = 1.0 - (0.5 + index)/N
phi = index * PI * (3 - sqrt(5))
cos_theta = z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or for cos-weigted points as 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
z = 1.0 - (0.5 + index)/N
phi = index * PI * (3 - sqrt(5))
cos_theta = sqrt(z)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here index is a value between from 0 to $N-1$. Works for non-power-of-two values of $N$. This uniform variant can also be adapted to the full sphere.

## Random point on hemisphere - $\cos$-weighted (alternate version)

WIP!

While I am writing this there have been a lot of discussions on twitter about a handy routine to generate random directions that are cosine weighted in the hemisphere. The benefit as far as I understand it is that it doesn't need to rotate into a basis around the normal vector. When I noticed the discussion I felt I lacked to tools to analyze it. In writing this I am trying to rectify that.

Here is pseudo-code for the proposed solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
vec3 random_hemisphere_cosine(normal,...) {
	p = point_on_unit_sphere(...)
	return normalize(p + normal)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There was also this incorrect version that gives direction $cos^{-3}$ distributed over the hemisphere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Incorrect distribution
vec3 random_hemisphere_cosine(normal,...) {
	p = point_in_unit_sphere(...)
	return normalize(p + normal)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I want to point out that $normalize(point\_in\_unit\_sphere(...)) = point\_on\_unit\_sphere(...)$. I do this only because a few post said that the second version only was correct if you normalized the result from $point\_in\_unit\_sphere(...)$, but if you that the second incorrect variant turns exactly into the first correct variant.
