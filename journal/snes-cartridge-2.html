Just wanted to give an update.

</p><p>

I managed to find an old &ldquo;standard&rdquo; edge connector with 2*23 pins (just like a SNES cartridge with no extension chips). I found it at the physical store <a href="http://www.temaelektronik.se">Tema Elektronik</a> here in Gothenburg. It is the only physical store that I know of that sells electronics stuff since ELFA closed (Kjell&co does have some stuff and they are super helpful, but still).

</p><p>

Here it is in all its glory:

</p><p>

<div class="image" style="float:right;margin:4px 0px 0px 25px;"><a  href="images/edgecon2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="markdeep" src="images/edgecon2.jpg" /></a ><div class="imagecaption">Standard edge connector</div></div>

</p><p>

When mounted on a game it looks like this:

</p><p>

<center><div class="image" style=""><a  href="images/edgecon_mounted.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="markdeep" src="images/edgecon_mounted.jpg" /></a ><div class="imagecaption">Mounted on SNES cartridge</div></div></center>

</p><p>

I'm not sure if it is 2.54mm or 2.5mm, probably 2.54mm since that is the standard. The game seems to fit tightly though. The pins are a bit large but do fit in a breadboard BUT they are not seperated enough to be placed on opposite sides of the &ldquo;ridge&rdquo;, thus is will short circuit. I haven't found a nice solution here yet... My hope is to be able to use the individual pins of a cable such as

</p><p>

<center><div class="image" style=""><a  href="images/cable-40p-male-female.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="markdeep" src="images/cable-40p-male-female.jpg" /></a ><div class="imagecaption">40-pin cable with male-female-connectors</div></div></center>

</p><p>

EDIT: This cable did not work. I got one and just looking at it I can see that the female end have too large holes. Seems that the pins on cables made for breadboards have quite large pins. Expect a future invective-filled post when I've soldered everything instead! I could go for clamp-based solution instead but f*ck it.

</p><p>

and use the females on the edge connector and the males on the breadboard. I do have everything I need to build cables myself, but I'll think I'll buy something this time. To be continued.

</p><p>

I also found some information on <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~bazz/snes/cartridges/">SNES Cartridges</a> here. Especially <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~bazz/snes/cartridges/electronics/simple_components.html">this</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~bazz/snes/cartridges/electronics/speeds.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~bazz/snes/cartridges/lorom.html">this</a> seems helpful. I will probably learn a lot from these.

</p><p>

Feels like I've taken a step forward somehow. I'm back at work after my parental leave and Rasmus has been giving me helpful tips on the electronics side so I feel that I should have something up and running. My biggest challenge is that the RaspberryPi model B+ only have 26 data pins (it has 40 in total, but only 26 that can be used as input/output). One can solder on 4 more somehow so that could be 30. The SNES OTOH uses 32-pins for adress (24-bit) and data (8-bit). Then I need some more pins to communicate.

</p><p>

Of the 46 snes pins I can disregard:

</p><p>

<ul>
<li class="asterisk">2 +5VDC
</li>
<li class="asterisk">2 GND
</li>
<li class="asterisk">4 CIC
</li>
<li class="asterisk">/CART will always be 1 for ROM extraction
</li>
<li class="asterisk">/RESET will probably always have one value
</li>
<li class="asterisk">CPU_CLOCK I might be abel to disregard
</li>
<li class="asterisk">Perhaps /RD can be ignored, don't know
</li>
<li class="asterisk">24-bit adresses means 16MB cartridges. Most games are smaller. Perhaps I can make a compromise here.</li></ul>

</p><p>

So if I'm lucky I only need 34 pins which is larger than 30. But for now I can try to extract first 64kb or something and then move on from there. If I later want to emulate a cartridge and play it back in the SNES I must be 5V and work with all the 46 pins so I need to figure out how to do that with the Raspberry (or with something else!).

</p><p>

Stay tuned!
