I've been meaning to do electronics projects with or for the kids. The first one to be finished was a MP3-player for my 2½ year old. She loves music and sings a lot, but she can't play music herself. She has to ask and then she always asks for the youtube version on the TV. Ideally I would have purchased her a casette deck or a CD-player, or even an old iPod... but whatever I did it had to be quite simple so she could use it.

</p><p>

I wanted to build something myself and I eventually found a cheap (4$) mp3-player chip. It has SD-card, MP3-player and an amplifier. I also bough a small loud speaker and some buttons. My good friend Albert helped me build it all into a nice plastic box. We went with a larger box which to make it more fun to use! And also easier to build. It has three buttons; play next song (volume up if held), play previous song (volume down if held) and a power switch. That is it as far as user interface goes.

Albert bullied me into using a larger speaker that I bought by mistake, insisting that everyone needs hifi. But when mounting it we had to crush it with a hammer so I'm not sure if it is hifi anymore. Albert also helped med with test songs on the SD-card which is how I got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpdsTeEldRA">rickrolled</a>. Thanks!

</p><p>

I put her favorite songs on it. The music box (&ldquo;musiklådan&rdquo;) is appreciated and used a lot. Maybe over time it will accumulate some stickers... we will see what happens :)

</p><p>

This was my project but huge thanks to Albert for making it happen this year. The physical box would not been as nice had I do. I sure loved to make a physical box! The mp3 chip has support for a lot more features that I'm not using. Maybe I should make a new project with something even cooler? I'm currently thinking about making a smaller version with a headphone jack or maybe having multiple profiles so we can have a set of songs for each family member... who knows!

Here are some details, mostly to help me remember what I ended up with!

</p><p>

<ul>
<li class="asterisk">MP3-chip is <a href="https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299">DFR0299 DFPlayer Mini</a>
</li>
<li class="asterisk">Running of 9V battery
<ul>
	<li class="asterisk">Voltage lowered to around 4.4V (mp3 chip wants 3.2-5V, prefers 4.2V)
<ul>
		<li class="asterisk">Using Voltage Regulator to get down to 5V
</li>
		<li class="asterisk">Using Zener Diode to lower that an additional 0.6V
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<li class="asterisk">Top and bottom of box separated by cables that can be detached. Makes it possible to decouple while building them/making improvements. Helps with cable mess.
</li>
<li class="asterisk">Some unused cables going to the lid was intended for on/off-switch but it made more sense to put the switch in the bottom of the box.</li></ul>
