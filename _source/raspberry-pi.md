So for this new year I've decided that I should learn something about electronics. It's been bugging me forever that I know so little. I've decided that a good entry level thing was to get a Raspberry PI and make some projects with it, trying to incoporate external devices where it might make sense. In doing so I hope to get a practical understanding of voltages, soldering and all that is associated with that!

I'm not sure what is realistic given my limited time, but if I learn anything then I've learned something and that is something.

# Current ideas for projects are:
* Make a synth for my audio-less usb-midi-keyboard that can produce some sort of piano sound in the headphone jack of the Raspberry Pi. No electronics but some low-level code.
* Make a SNES cartridge that can play my homebrew ROMs. Not sure if feasibly but I would surely learn a lot. This project is of course already "done", but I'd still like to give it a go. Would also be fun to capture ROM's from existing games.

Stay tuned for possible updates!
