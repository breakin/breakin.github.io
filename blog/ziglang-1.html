<p>

I've been searching for a new (or old!) language to use instead of C++. There has been many languages that has gotten a lot of hype and I've done a hello world program in a few of them. I then usually get stuck on building dependencies and understanding build systems instead of actually writing any code. Being on Windows never help when trying to get dependencies to work! That being said I do get a glimpse of the languages before I <em class="asterisk">sigh</em> and go back to C++.

</p><p>

Todays language is <a href="https://ziglang.org/">ziglang</a>. Where <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> tries to be a better C++, <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> tries to be a better C. I feel that it has a lot of overlap with <a href="https://dlang.org/">dlang</a> but the language is smaller, both in terms of language constructs and standard library. I have a feeling that it has a lot of overlap with the Jai programming language but I haven't followed it that closely so not sure if that feeling is right or not!

</p><p>

Either way it has been really easy getting into it language wise and it has been very fun so far!

</p>
<a class="target" name="documentation&packagemanagement">&nbsp;</a><a class="target" name="toc2">&nbsp;</a><h1>Documentation & Package Management</h1>
<p>

The hardest part has been documentation. The intro documentation is good but there is not enough. I've found really well-written blog posts and github repros exist but they are often outdated since the language is currently moving quite fast. Without proper documentation it is hard to know how to manually migrate them.

</p><p>

Syntax and standard library has changed a lot and it does not seem to be slowing down, although changes might affect details more.

</p><p>

I reported one bug for the Murmur hash in the standard library. It was fixed but It was suggested to me to try another hash (probably a good advice) and that maybe the murmur hash should not be part of the standard library. It seems like the standard library will shrink a lot before 1.0 and code that is exvluded will probably end up in community-managed packages instead.

</p><p>

As far as I understand it there is no official package manager yet so I am not sure what that will look like. There is, however, a good build system once the packages are out so that is very promising. 

</p><p>

The <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community">ziglang community</a> has been really helpful and I recommend trying something out if you get stuck. I had good luck with the discord channel!

</p>
<a class="target" name="webassembly">&nbsp;</a><a class="target" name="toc3">&nbsp;</a><h1>WebAssembly</h1>
<p>

I think one big reason that I'm having a lot of fun this time is that I am targeting WebAssembly instead of native. That means that I don't want all the C++ dependencies. I want a few C++ dependencies but most of them can probably be compiled to WebAssembly using emscripten.

</p><p>

<em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> is good at interacting with c-dependencies (they can be included, sometimes source and all) and compiled to WebAssembly. At least that is the pitch, I haven't tried that many yet and there are caveats. Another perk of sitting in the browser is that if there something I need support for I can probably lean on the browser to decode say an image format I don't have a <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> decoder for.

</p><p>

<em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> can target WebAssembly without requiring the emscripten toolchain. I have nothing bad to say about emscripten but it sure feels nice to have a smallish well-behaved binary (and standard library) that can compiler directly into WebAssembly. No environment variables required! The term smallish is probablu due to the LLVM-library that is part of the compiler; it adds quite some space to binaries! The <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> binary can cross-compile to everything it supports on all operating systems so that probably increase the size quite a bit too (having to include all the LLVM targets).

</p><p>

Since I am working as a webdev I though it would be neat if I could get the zig compiler via NPM (to get compiler and standard library versioned with my repro) but that was not possible right now.

</p>
<a class="target" name="compiletime(reflection)">&nbsp;</a><a class="target" name="toc4">&nbsp;</a><h1>Compile Time (Reflection)</h1>
<p>

One important feature I've been after in moving from C/C++ is proper compile time reflection. And better compile time interaction overall. This has always been something <a href="https://dlang.org/">dlang</a> has been good at. Ziglang delivers so far!

</p><p>

What I'm after is a good replacement of the C-preprocessor. I want something that is aware of types but that is not as complex as C++ templates in terms of readability and compile time.

</p><p>

In <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> I've found that a lot of code seems be fully usable at compile time and the compiler is helpful in telling you when you violate things. You can also check such that you are running your function at compile time.

</p><p>

A good introduction to ziglang compile time can be found <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime/">here</a>.

</p><p>

I have not found a way to inspect the code generated at compile time. Maybe it shows up if I try to debug my program. This is something I am looking at. But you can always look at asm if you really must know!

</p>
<a class="target" name="example:compiletimereflection">&nbsp;</a><a class="target" name="toc4.1">&nbsp;</a><h2>Example: Compile Time Reflection</h2>
<p>


I'm looking to build a material system for a WebGL2 renderer.

</p><p>

First I have some struct
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// Generic system for materials</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">pub</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> MaterialStateTexture = <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {</span>
    texture_id: c_uint = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
};</code></pre><p>

Here we can see that types (such as structs) are first class in <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em>. The type is stored in the variable MaterialStateTexture.

</p><p>

Now let us define a struct holding some properties
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code>can still <span class="hljs-keyword">be</span> used <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> instancing etc
<span class="hljs-keyword">pub</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> PBRMaterialState = <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {</span>
    albedo_texture: MaterialStateTexture = MaterialStateTexture {},
    emissive_texture: MaterialStateTexture = MaterialStateTexture {},
    roughness: <span class="hljs-built_in">f32</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>,

    ...</code></pre><p>

Now let us say that we want to create a function that calculate a hash key based on the content of the struct. We do this as a member function of our struct
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">pub</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hljs-title">calculate_hash</span></span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>: PBRMaterialState) <span class="hljs-built_in">u64</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> hasher = hash.Murmur2_64;
        var hv : <span class="hljs-built_in">u64</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> t = @typeInfo(PBRMaterialState);
        inline <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (t.Struct.fields) |value| {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (value.field_type == MaterialStateTexture) {
                hv = hasher.hashUint32WithSeed(
                    @field(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>, value.name).texture_id,
                    hv
                );
                }
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> hv;
    }</code></pre><p>
So there is a lot to unpack here. This function is executed at runtime, but the inline for is unrolled such that at runtime it is no longer a loop. The function <em class="asterisk">@typeInfo</em> can only work at compile time when we have type information. The same goes for the expression <em class="asterisk">inline for</em>. Since <em class="asterisk">value</em> is compile-time known the if-statement will also be evaluated at compile time.

</p><p>

I imagine that what is left looks like this when preprocessed
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code>    <span class="hljs-keyword">pub</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hljs-title">calculate_hash_preprocessed</span></span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>: PBRMaterialState) <span class="hljs-built_in">u64</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> hasher = hash.Murmur2_64;
        var hv : <span class="hljs-built_in">u64</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        hv = hasher.hashUint32WithSeed(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.albedo_texture.texture_id, hv);
        hv = hasher.hashUint32WithSeed(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.emissive_texture.texture_id, hv);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> hv;
    }</code></pre><p>
(but I haven't found a way to actually see the generated code). I am not sure if that matters; the compiler has been very helpful so far. It is also possible to log things during compile time which helps in understanding what happens.

</p><p>

Now all we have to do is to finish the struct
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code>}<span class="hljs-comment">;</span></code></pre><p>

Now in our program we can do
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code>const <span class="hljs-keyword">ms</span> <span class="hljs-title">= PBRMaterialState</span> {};
const hash_value = ms.calculate_hash();</code></pre><p>

If we want to we could have made the calculate_hash function a generic function, taking any type. The signature would then be

</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">pub</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hljs-title">calculate_hash</span></span>(our_struct: anytype) <span class="hljs-built_in">u64</span> {</code></pre><p>

This allow us to do
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code>const <span class="hljs-keyword">ms</span> <span class="hljs-title">= PBRMaterialState</span> {};
const hash_value = calculate_hash(ms);</code></pre><p>

If we need the type of <em class="asterisk">our_struct</em> inside <em class="asterisk">calculate_hash</em> we can get it using <em class="asterisk">@typeOf(our_struct)</em>.

</p>
<a class="target" name="example:detecthashcollisions">&nbsp;</a><a class="target" name="toc4.2">&nbsp;</a><h2>Example: Detect hash collisions</h2>
<p>


This one kinda failed but it is still interesting to think about. A common case to store string is to use hashing (and hope that there is no collision) or perfect hashing (when all strings are known in advance). <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> can easily make a hash-function for a string that gives out a number, and if it is called many times it will even remember the returned value and only run it once (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">Memoization</a>).

</p><p>

First. Writing a hasher is trivial. Here is one for numbers:
</p><pre class="listing tilde"><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> <span class="hljs-title">fn_hash</span></span>(comptime T : <span class="hljs-built_in">u32</span>) <span class="hljs-built_in">u32</span> {
    comptime {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> hasher = hash.Murmur2_32;
        var a : <span class="hljs-built_in">u32</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
        a = hasher.hashUint32WithSeed(T, a);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a;
    }
}</code></pre><p>
The same approach works for strings too since they are known at compile time but you have to change some words.

</p><p>

But what about collisions? I have not been able to do something that checks if there was a collision. It is currently possible to create a closure inside the compile-time function that remember things between invocations (with unspecified order). Using that an array of hashes and the first string to produce it can be created. Ever time a new string is hashes it can be controlled such that we are using the same string. But rumor on the discord channel was that these closures would probably would go away soon so without I don't know if it is solvable.

</p><p>

It is also not possible to do lazy compile time values, which makes sense since they can influence compilation. I am still discovering what makes sense or not and I don't know if this is a real problem or not.

</p><p>

I think my approach now will be to specify all string up-front, but let each file contribute a list of strings such that it can be somewhat modular. It would be nice to be able to detect unused strings though somehow. Lets see what I come up with.

<p>

I have no idea if I will actually use <em class="asterisk">ziglang</em> or not but I will at least keep an eye on it. It feels like it could be a better C and might actually be exactly what I want for a lot of cases. It makes sense for anything embedded as well as WebAssembly. I could see myself writing a lot of different types of programs in it. In the end I might end up in Rust instead but it just doesn't feel fun and fun is a big factor for smaller projects, especially hobby projects. I recommend testing it out!
